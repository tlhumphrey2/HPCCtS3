Beginner Contributor Guide
==========================

This document is for those who have never contributed to our Machine Learning (ML) Project and/or never contributed to any github project.

What we hope to cover, here, is everything you need to get started as a contributor. I believe the following list covers everything. By the way, you can use the order of this list to tell you when to do what.

 - Get a github account (click [here](#get-github-account) for instructions).
 - Download git onto your PC (click [here](#download-git) for instructions).
 - Setup git onto your PC (click [here](#setup-git) for instructions).
 - On github, fork the ML repository (click [here](#fork-ml-repository) for instructions).
 - Make a local copy of the ML repository from your fork (click [here](#make-ml-repository-local-copy) for instructions).
 - Get access to our THOR cluster for contributors or download a VMWare HPCC System (click [here](#get-access-to-thor-cluster) for instructions).
 - Download ECL IDE (click [here](#download-ecl-ide) for instructions).
 - Configure ECL IDE so your local ML repository can be seen in ECL IDE.
 - Learn ECL (click [here](#configure-ecl-ide) for instructions).
 - Run some of the example ML programs (click [here](#run-example-ml-programs) for example).
 - Decide what contribution you want to make (look at our [Current Needs](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/ecl-ml/CurrentNeeds.md)).
